# Currency Double Dollar Sign Fix - Complete

## Issue Summary

The AI assistant was displaying currency values with double dollar signs (`$$123.45`) instead of single dollar signs (`$123.45`) due to manual `$` symbols being prepended to `toLocaleString` calls that already included `style: 'currency'`.

## Root Cause

The problematic pattern was:

```javascript
`$${amount.toLocaleString("es-MX", { style: "currency", currency: "MXN" })}`;
```

When `toLocaleString` with `style: 'currency'` already adds the currency symbol, prepending a manual `$` resulted in `$$amount`.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `lib/ai-assistant.ts`

**Fixed 13 instances:**

- Line 216: Monthly expenses in quick responses
- Line 244: Top category amount in quick responses
- Line 269: Projected savings amount
- Line 336: Account balances in context string
- Lines 339-341: Monthly income, expenses, and balance in context
- Lines 345-347: Yearly income, expenses, and average spending in context
- Line 355: Category amounts in context
- Lines 376-377: Total balance and largest expense in context

### 2. `app/api/[[...route]]/ai-assistant.ts`

**Fixed 8 instances:**

- Line 86: Fallback response balance (already fixed by user)
- Line 534: Total balance in quick insights
- Line 541: Monthly expenses in quick insights
- Line 558: Top category amount in quick insights
- Line 594: Deficit amount in risk factors
- Line 668: Potential savings in opportunities
- Line 696: Additional savings amounts (2 instances)
- Line 721: Excess cash for investment

## Solution Applied

Replaced all instances of:

```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
`$${amount.toLocaleString("es-MX", {
  style: "currency",
  currency: "MXN",
})}`// AFTER (correct)
`${amount.toLocaleString("es-MX", { style: "currency", currency: "MXN" })}`;
```

## Testing

Created and ran `test-currency-fix.js` which confirmed:

- **OLD**: `$$1,234.56` (double dollar sign)
- **NEW**: `$1,234.56` (correct single dollar sign)

## Result

✅ All currency formatting in AI assistant responses now displays correctly without double dollar signs
✅ No compilation errors introduced
✅ Consistent currency formatting across all AI assistant features
✅ Proper use of Mexican peso formatting with Spanish locale

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Search for any remaining problematic patterns
grep -r "\$\$.*toLocaleString" . --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"
# Should return no matches

# Test currency formatting
node test-currency-fix.js
```

The double dollar sign issue in AI assistant responses has been completely resolved.
